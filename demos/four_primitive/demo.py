Four-Primitive Integration Demo — PACT-AX

Scenario
────────
Marcus is mid-career pivot. Three months of coaching with Agent-A (generalist).
A crisis arrives: competing job offer, 48-hour deadline, non-compete clause he
didn't fully read. Agent-A hits its capability limit. Handoff to Agent-B
(compensation specialist) must happen — but Marcus's story has to survive it.

The four primitives — and what breaks without each one:

  StoryKeeper   — 3 months of narrative don't vanish at the seam
  StateTransfer — structured offer data transfers cleanly and verifiably
  ContextShare  — Agent-B gets the context relevant to its role, not everything
  Trust         — the handoff is gated; outcome feeds back into the trust network

The demo's core moment: we show what Agent-B receives WITH vs WITHOUT
StoryKeeper. That difference is what PACT-AX is for.
